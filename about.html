                        <p>My name is Geoff Safcik. I am a professional photographer and the owner of GS Photography. When I take a portrait of someone, I try to capture the emotion of that person and to create a portrait of who they really are. Yes, this includes children. I strive to always provide you with exceptional works of art and superior service. I am always eager to help you through your photographic journey, from start to finish, which is very valuable these days.</p>
                        <p>On a personal note, I am married and have two amazing boys that keep me on my toes!</p>

                                <h4>Children's &amp; Portrait Photography</h4>
                                <p>Every new parent knows the joy that a child can bring to the table. I am one. Many of us want to capture photographs of our children each and every single day. Let GS Photography help you make memorable moments that you'll want to hang on the wall for all time! GS Photography is the children's photographer you want because I am in your shoes. All sorts of child photography is imaginable here, everything from posed, studio-type sessions in the comfort of your home to sessions where your child is surrounded by the natural Colorado landscape.</p>
                                <p>Don't worry, if parents want to hop in a number of the photographs, I don't mind. Family photography is something I do as well! You'll love these photographs so much that these works of art will be passed down for generations.</p>

                                <p>If you're seeking for a Denver portrait photographer, look no further because I cover all of the Denver area. Perhaps you are looking for a Boulder portrait photographer? I also cover Boulder county in its entirety. I am based out of Broomfield but I even travel up north, making me the premier Fort Collins portrait photographer that you want to work with.</p>
                                <p>Basically, I am the Colorado portrait photographer you seek so don't waste time and contact me today to book your session. Please note that if you are more than 30 miles outside of Broomfield, I do charge a small travel fee.</p>
